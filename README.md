# Heart-DSS-Prediction
This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning prediction, and the generated model. The dataset has 14 features (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure) and a target variable for heart disease, ideal for building and evaluating ML models in healthcare.
