# Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive project for predicting heart diseases using machine learning models. It includes the following components:

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing various health metrics and predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The dataset has 14 features, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, which serve as inputs for building classification models. The project demonstrates end-to-end steps, including data loading, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

# Repository Contents
1. Heart_DSS_Prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that contains code for:

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Building and evaluating machine learning models
Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
Generating and saving the final model
heart-disease.csv: The dataset used for the project. It contains 303 rows and 14 columns representing various health-related attributes of patients.

3. my_RandomizedSearchCV_model.pkl: The saved machine learning model generated from the Jupyter Notebook. This model was optimized using RandomizedSearchCV and can be used directly for predictions.
